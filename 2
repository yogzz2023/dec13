Creating UML diagrams for your code can help visualize the structure and flow of your application. Below are the PlantUML codes for the state transition diagram, activity diagram, and sequence diagram based on the provided code.

### State Transition Diagram

The state transition diagram will represent the different states a track can be in and how it transitions between these states.

```plantuml
@startuml
[*] --> Poss1
Poss1 --> Tentative1 : Hit count >= threshold
Tentative1 --> Firm : Hit count >= threshold
Poss1 --> [*] : Timeout
Tentative1 --> [*] : Timeout
Firm --> [*] : Timeout
@enduml
```

### Activity Diagram

The activity diagram will illustrate the flow of operations in your `main` function, focusing on processing measurement groups and updating tracks.

```plantuml
@startuml
start
:Read measurements from CSV;
repeat
    :Get next measurement group;
    if (Single measurement?) then (yes)
        :Check correlation with existing tracks;
        if (Correlated?) then (yes)
            :Update track;
        else (no)
            :Create new track;
        endif
    else (no)
        :Perform association (JPDA/Munkres);
        :Update tracks with best reports;
    endif
repeat while (More measurement groups?)
:Check track timeouts;
:Update track states;
stop
@enduml
```

### Sequence Diagram

The sequence diagram will show the interaction between different components when processing data and updating tracks.

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant "KalmanFilterGUI" as GUI
participant "main" as Main
participant "CVFilter" as Filter
participant "Track" as Track

User -> GUI: Select File
User -> GUI: Click Process
GUI -> Main: process_data()
Main -> Main: read_measurements_from_csv()
Main -> Main: form_measurement_groups()
Main -> Filter: initialize_filter_state()
Main -> Track: Check correlation
alt Correlated
    Main -> Filter: predict_step()
    Main -> Filter: update_step()
else Not Correlated
    Main -> Track: Create new track
end
Main -> Main: check_track_timeout()
Main -> Main: update_track_states()
GUI -> GUI: update_plot()
@enduml
```

These diagrams provide a high-level overview of the state transitions, activities, and interactions in your code. You can use PlantUML to render these diagrams into visual representations.
